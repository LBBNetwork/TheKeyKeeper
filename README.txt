Source code to The Key Keeper v1.0. Requires Visual Basic 6. See LICENSE.TXT for license info.

Also important to note: All the keys in the program have been replaced with dummy keys.
I'm sure there's a clause somewhere in the GitHub ToS preventing you from distributing keys to any software in source code.
